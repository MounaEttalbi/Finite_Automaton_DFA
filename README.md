"# Finite_Automaton_DFA" 
This project implements a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), a theoretical model of computation used in automata theory and formal language theory. The DFA recognizes strings that belong to a specified regular language defined by its states, alphabet, transitions, and acceptance criteria.

Features
DFA Definition: Define states, alphabet, transitions, start state, and acceptance states.
String Recognition: Input strings to check if they are accepted by the DFA.

Components
States (Q): Finite set of states.
Alphabet (Σ): Finite set of input symbols.
Transitions (δ): Transition function defining state changes based on input symbols.
Start State (q₀): Initial state where computation begins.
Acceptance States (F): Set of states where the DFA accepts input strings.
